<h2>What I've learned</h2>
Over the course of this project I have learned how to use python and the pygame library, make a technical & functional design and how to plan a project.

For me the most difficult part of a project is planning it. So I spent quite some time on making the designs. I learned a lot during this period including; scope definition, time management, working with imaging programs(paint.net/GIMP), flowcharting etc.

I would say that my initial project plan is insufficient, as halfway through I revisited how to make it and created templates for use in future projects, and this project's plan is nowhere near the depth I put in the templates.

I had some previous experience with python and the pygame libary, but this project made me a lot better at it.
